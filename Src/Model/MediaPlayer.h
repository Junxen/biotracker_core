/**
 * The MediaPlayer class is an IModel class an part of the MediaPlayer component. This class creats a MediaPlayerStateMachine object and moves it to a QThread.
 * The MediaPlayer class controlls and represents the results of the MediaPlayerStateMachine. The communication between a MediaPlayer object and a MediaPlayerStateMachine object is done by
 * Qts SIGNALS and SLOTS. This is due to the fact that SIGNALS and SLTOS are thread safe. A disadvantage is that SIGNALS and SLOTS are slower then normal function calls.
 *
 * The constructor of this class is responsible for connecting to the MediaPlayerStateMachine.
